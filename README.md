SpeechBuddy
===========

Project website [https://gnadnivek.github.io/](https://gnadnivek.github.io/)

Proposal
--------

An intelligent voice interface that is able to listen and interpret what the
user has spoken. Input will be translated into text and stored in a SQL
database.

The problem this project solves is that it helps users take simple notes, such
as a grocery list or small reminders for when you don’t have a pen and paper
available. This project will help solved problems where people forget an
important detail or appointment, by storing what the user says into a readable
text format.

Similar to Apples Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana.
